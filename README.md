# ðŸ“ˆ Multi-Agent Stock Market Analysis System

This project is an intelligent **multi-agent system** designed to analyze a company's stock and evaluate its investment potential using OpenAI's LLMs and the `autogen` framework. The system simulates a collaborative team of agents, each playing a specialized role in the analysis pipelineâ€”from market research to financial assessment to risk advisory.

## ðŸ§  System Overview

The system includes four key agents working in sequence:

1. **User Proxy Agent** (`Stock_Analyst`)  
   Acts as the human initiator, triggering the analysis workflow with a company name or stock ticker.

2. **Market Researcher Agent** (`market_researcher`)  
   Gathers up-to-date stock data, analyst recommendations, relevant news, and industry trends.

3. **Financial Analyst Agent** (`financial_analyst`)  
   Evaluates key financial metrics such as P/E ratio, Market Cap, and EPS, and compares them with industry benchmarks.

4. **Risk Advisor Agent** (`risk_advisor`)  
   Assesses risks including market volatility, regulatory concerns, and macroeconomic conditions, providing investment caution.
